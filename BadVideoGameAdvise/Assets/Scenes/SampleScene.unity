    there?

  - 10. There's no point in making games unless they sell well enough to cover their
    costs.
  - 11. You don't need to know everything to do great things. Just pick a subject
    you care about and then learn everything you can about it. That's the quickest
    way to master it.
  - 12. If you aren't sure what to do, just try doing nothing.
  - 13. Good designers are always looking for ways to improve their own designs.

    isn't really the point either.

  - 2. Don't make them too smart, they'll find a way around it (Don't give them time
    to think)
  - 3. Give them what they want, then take away their choices (Only let them choose
    what's good for them)
  - 4. Let them fail, if it means we learn something (Let them lose, so they win)

  - 6. Try to keep them happy, but let them know how much you care (Make them feel
    special)
  - 7. If they ask where it came from, tell them it was magic (If they ask why, tell
    them it doesn't matter)
  - 8. Let them try different things, but keep track of who likes what (Give them
    freedom, but keep tabs)
  - 9. Have fun while doing it (It's not supposed to be serious)
  - 10. Be fair, but don't be nice (They'll hate you anyway)
  - 11. Don't get attached, just do your job (Don't fall in love)
  - 12. Put the player first, but remember the audience (Put them first, but keep
    the fans in mind)
  - 13. Never forget where it started (Never forget where it came from)
  - 14. Show some respect, but always be yourself (Show some respect, but never imitate)
  - 1. "The best way to get a job at a company is to work hard."
  - 2. "If you're working on a project, do not discuss what you are doing. Discussing
    your current project will only distract your team members' attention away from
    their own tasks.
  - 3. "When designing a game, try to think outside the box."
  - 4. "Never put a gun in a holster designed for a sword."
